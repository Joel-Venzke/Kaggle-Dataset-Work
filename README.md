## Spotify song populartity regression (Feb 8, 2021 - Feb 12, 2021)
Working with the [Kaggle Spotify Dataset 1921-2020, 160k+ Tracks dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-160k-tracks)

Trained RandomForest, DNN, LinearRegression, and LinearSVR to predict songs populartiy. Obtained a RMSE error of 12.300 which is nearly 2x more accurate than guessing the average popularity.
